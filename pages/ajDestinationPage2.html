					<br>Shocked or surprised to see a Pure Veg tag with a Chinese Restaurant, me too when i first saw it especially in the Koramangala-HSR belt where pure vegetarian restaurants are as few as tigers in our country!!!! 
						<br><br>
						For a regular outsite eater like me it was quite an unique experience especially if you have the company of Uppi,Swetha,Ramu and Viks!!!Viks and I had stayed back in office due to work and were planning to leave  office at around 7:45pm where we suddenly caught hold of Uppi Dada. Uppi was in great mood(dont know the reason why) and was also very hungry i guess. 7:45 pm is such a bad time in office because you just dont get anything sizeable to eat. The very thought of waiting for another one hour for dinner at office flashed a lightning idea in Uppi's mind to go out for dinner and I was quick to oblige obviously to avoid home food on that day. Ultimately it was decided to go to HSR and then find a hotel and off we went in our Hondas.
						<br><br>
						After few confusions regarding the direction I and Viks reached LOU HAN after Uppi,Ramu and Swetha had arrived. Now here enter Swetha and Ramu as they were not part of the original plan but later it was on Uppi's request and Swetha's suggestion of Lou Han nearby to all that both of them entered into the scene.
						<br><br>
						ENTER THE DRAGON was the feeling when we entered seeing all the ancient Chinese artifacts and also I was still in an astonishing mood seeing a Veg tag for a Chinese hotel. I and Viks joined the small table for five with an extra chair where others were seated but i felt it was small atleast for my apetite. Swetha too felt the same and we decided to shift to a larger table as I overheard Ramu and Swetha speaking "Woh Chillayigi, Swetha tu Sambhal Lena"!!! 
						Now there was one more drama which had happened before we came which I was unaware of. The restaurant owner's wife who was in charge that day had asked these 3 ppl to occupy the bigger table(the one which we were going to occupy now) since we were 5 but they felt that the smaller one would satisfy our needs so they rejected her offer and went and sat on the smaller one. The owner' wife was slightly furious with that one naturally but had then served water on the previous table. She had gone inside the kitchen when we shifted to the bigger table just like sly cats.
						<br><br>
						ENTER THE REAL DRAGON when she came back out of the kitchen and saw us in her recommended table. Wow the words that came out were pure Chinese fire and we just had to duck it. Our journey was just beginning. Now for half an hour she did not put plates or give a glass of water leave alone taking the order, I guess she was furious.Unfortunately on that day there was only one cook,one waiter and this lady as all the others had gone on vacation due to Christmas-New year.  She sent the smart looking hair over face waiter to take the order. Now this was one of the greatest part, for whatever we ordered we got an answer "Time lagega",soup time lagega ek ghanta lagega, noodles time lagega. Swetha got frustrated and asked atleast can you get finger chips quickly his answer was stunningly "Time lagega Madam,Dekho Aloo ko lena padega, kaatna padega phir thel me dalna padega,time to lagega!!!" we broke out into big time laughter. After coming back to senses we finally ordered Hot and Sour soup,Manchow soup,Wanton soup, Singapore flat noodles , Macaroni and finally Ramu's favorite Soya Fish( one dipped in Schezwan sauce and another in noodle sauce).  Everybody please note that Soya Fish is a PURE VEG dish which is made fully of Soya dipped in sauce of your choice. This was verified, tested over many times and signed off personally by none other than our very own Ramu, after i looked at him hearing this!!!!!!
						<br><br>
						Without Uppi's ghost stories, Ramu's innocence, Swetha's smartness, Viks's wry smiles and my silence we  would have had to start eating our body parts(HUNGRY DRAGONS) as they took almost one and a half hour to get our first dish, Soups !!! We got lost into Pune,Mumbai,Mangalore(famous Bittu da Dhaba,atleast for Uppi and me), gullies of China in that one and a half hour before we had the sight of our dish. But then the rest of the dishes came very quickly and the wait was well worth it!!! I enjoyed every sip and byte of food at Lou Han, yummy. Simple and definitely affordable. A must go for all Vegans atleast.
						<br><br>
						 Finally we settled the bill with the famous Aunty(fiery but good at heart) who was now in good mood  as Uppi had spoken a few Chinese words with her when she had served Pepsi. So Alls well that ends well  and we all ended that night with a sweet Maghai Paan outsite the restaurant.
						<br><br>
						But what an evening it turned out to be, an unforgettable enjoyable moment atleast in my short biological life span. Thanks to Swetha,Ramu, Uppi and Viks!!!!
						Xie Xie once again!!!</br>
